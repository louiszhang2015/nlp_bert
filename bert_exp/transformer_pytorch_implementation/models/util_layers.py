# The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

# The main purpose of normalization is to provide a uniform scale for numerical values.
# If the dataset contains numerical data varying in a huge range, it will skew the learning process, resulting in a bad model.
# The normalization method ensures there is no loss of information and even the range of values isnâ€™t affected.
